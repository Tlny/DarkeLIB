(*)	These guilds are currently being developed and coded as you read
	this text. They should be finished around the same time as other
	continuing projects, within the present future (due to security 
	reasons we may not release the finishing dates or we may be
	mobbed, have another mud steal our secrets, and crash) =)

(+)	Details and sketches of these guilds have been set aside or
	worked on, but are not priorities. They will be coded after the
	areas, priority guilds, and bug repairs.

(-)	These guilds are on the backburner. The ideas have been merited
	and the guilds will be coded sometime in the foreseable future,
	possibly even sometime within our lifetime. =)
