		    =-=-=- Barbarian -=-=-=

	The Barbarian is usually generalized as being roughly 
and scantily clad, powerfully built, and having a real savvy of 
the outdoors. The Barbarian can be described as one who lives life 
in its purest and most primitive state. Robust, courageous, and
uncomplicated, these men and women have no knowledge or interest 
whatsoever with anything magical, and are extremely powerful 
weapons specialists, second only to fighters. Barbarians rarely 
tolerate armour, and prefer to defend themselves with their skills, 
quick defensive reactions, and intimate familiarity with the wilds.

Type:   Primitive, Powerful Warrior
Skills: Lots of combat skills
Spells: None
Prime Attributes: Dex, Con, Str

Comments: The barbarian is powerful, has quick reflexes, and knows
	and understands the wilds. While not as skilled in combat
	as a fighter, barbarians manage quite well on their own.
