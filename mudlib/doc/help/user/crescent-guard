		  =-=-=- Crescent-Guard -=-=-=

	The Crescent-Guards were formed when the ability to 
harness the inner energies of the body were discovered by 
several of the greatest warriors in the history of the 
Shadowlands, including the great hero Archangel Celeborn, who
has recently ascended to the ranks of Demi-God. Crescent-Guards 
are unparalled warriors with the discipline and skill to match 
any armed or unarmed warrior, and the enhanced abilities gained 
through the harnessing of inner energies. 
	They are a guild developed and led by Celeborn to 
protect their fellow denizens from the forces of evil, and 
train extensively in all forms of combat. Now that Celeborn is
a God, he continues to watch over the Guards and oversee their
devotion to the ideals he initiated. Each Crescent-Guard must 
swear an oath upon his initiation into the guild to uphold the 
ideals of truth and goodness, and to guard against the reutrn 
of their mortal enemies, the Order of the Blessed Return.

Type:   Specialized Semi-Warrior
Skills: Specialized combat
Spells: <Techniques>-Combat, Enhanced Attacks
Prime Attributes: Dex, Con, Int

Examples: These are based upon ancient martial arts movies, of
	people fighting at tremendous speeds with great power.
Comments: Crescent-Guards are highly specialized combat experts
	who can paralyze by hitting the right pressure point,
	or heal themselves through self induced trances.
	Their unique and powerful abilities do not come without
	a price however. Since their techniques draw upon the
	inner body energies of life, they drain their own life
	forces to power these techniques. As a result, HP and
	MP are both used. The more powerful abilities may drain
	as much as half or more of a Guard's lifeforce.
