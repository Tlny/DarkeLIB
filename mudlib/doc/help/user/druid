		    =-=-=- Druid -=-=-=

	Historically, druids lived among the Germanic tribes
of Western Europe and Britain during the age of the Roman
Empire. They acted as advisors and held great influence among 
the people. Respected for their neutrality, Druids firmly
believe that the land is the mother and source of all life,
and consequently either worship the land itself, or the gods
tied to the land.
