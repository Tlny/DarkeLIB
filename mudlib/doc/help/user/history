This is a quick history of the making of DarkeMUD. 

1993  Diewarzau & Vishnu took over DarkeMUD from Drake U. (DarkeMUD I)
1994  DarkeMUD was lost on a computer... ACK! (DarkeMUD II)
1994  Diewarzau & Drizzt recovered the mud and moved it to
        Impaler at Rice U.
      Drizzt redesigned DarkeMUD... I.E. a new combat and skill
        system.  Diewarzau, Drizzt, & Warsyn designed the rest of 
        the mud.  (DarkeMUD III)  DarkeMUD also moved to mudOS.
1994  Late that winter the mud was lost again at Rice U.
1995  Blade gave us a temp. site which we moved the mud to after
        recovering from Rice.  Diewarzau, Drizzt, Mikus, and Warsyn 
        revised the design of (DarkeMUD IV) into the present system. 
        We backup the mud a lot now!
1996  Feb. 10th DarkeMUD moved to shadowlands.com at ICSI for its 
        permanent home.  The admin purchased a 486-120 w/ 32megs.
1996  Feb. 18th, 3am  DarkeMUD tried to open.
1996  Early March we went back to beta due to some bugs with the
        locker system and we decided to wait till we rounded off
        all of the guilds
1996  Early April we wizlocked the mud to get more work done.
1996  May 15th, The DarkeMUD webpage was redone by Drizzt.
1996  May 30th, 10am DarkeMUD officially opened!!!
